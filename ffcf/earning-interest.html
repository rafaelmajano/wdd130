            <p>
                Now, let’s learn how to use interest, specifically compound interest, to our favor. <br>
                The following example illustrates how we can make better financial decisions if, instead of buying our goods now with the use of credit, we have the discipline and wait and save for a while. We will use a similar monthly payment to the one used in our credit paying example, but this time rounding the monthly payment to $1,000 for the same 72-month period. Since the banks do not pay the same interest to their customers as the one that they request from them, we will use a 5% interest rate.

                            From the example we conclude that:
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            1.	A person who saves $1,000 a month can have enough money to buy the same car within less than 4 years. <br>
                            2.	If this person continues to save the same amount of money, will still be able to save the extra amount of about $29,638 by the end of the 72-month period. <br>
                            3.	By saving instead of using credit for financing the bought of the car, the person has saved more than $55,760 when considering his/her savings after the 72 months and the extra money that was not paid due to the interests, which is enough to buy another car of a similar price.
