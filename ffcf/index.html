                    According to the AI Gemini, in simple terms, a budget is a financial plan for a specific period, like a month or a year, that tracks a person’s income and expenses. It serves as a roadmap to guide a person's spendings and help him/her meet specific financial goals, like increasing savings or reducing debt. It is a tool that, if the person or family uses it with discipline, could help them to ensure that they do not spend more than they earn. In this website we will learn how to create a monthly income.

                    For this purpose, income is the money that an individual receives in exchange for labor or provided service. When used for creating a budget, it will be considered for the same period that the budget will include.

                    We will define it as the money spent on something, such taxes, donations, and other spendings like food, clothing, services, etc. In this case, we will consider all the spendings made for a person or family within a month period. We can classify our expenditures as fixed or variable.

                    It is a cost that remains the same from a period to the next, making it predictable and stable; for example: Rent or mortgage, car payments, insurances, subscriptions or memberships, taxes, tuition, services (internet, cell phone), and current debts (loan payments).

                    They are those that change in cost and occurrence, so can be difficult to plan for as they may vary, such as unforeseen events or discretionary spending. For example: Groceries, gas, entertainment, medical care, clothing, personal care, eating out, hobbies, and utilities (electricity, water, gas, etc.).

                    A "financial interest" is any stake or potential monetary gain an individual, their family, or a business has in a financial asset, transaction, or enterprise. Put in simple terms, is the extra money you pay to banks for using their money, like when you buy with a credit card and you do not pay the whole amount after a monthly period, or when you get a loan to buy something at the moment and then you keep paying for a period of time.

                    Compound Interest
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Compound interest is the interest earned on both the initial principal amount and on the accumulated interest from previous periods. It's often described as earning "interest on interest" and causes your savings or investment to grow at an accelerating rate over time, like a snowball effect. Unfortunately, since not all of us understand it, this is also the way we make rich people richer as we become poor and poor.
