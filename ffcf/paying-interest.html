                <h1>Paying Interest</h1>
                <p>
                    Now that we have some notion about interest, lets see how it is used by the financial system. <br>
                    Every time we use credit for paying, we will pay interest to the financial entity that provided the credit. In the following example, we will see how interest makes us pay more than we expect to when buying a car. <br>
                    Let’s suppose we want to buy a fifty thousand dollars car (Its brand and whether if it is new or used or no is out of the scope of this example). We do not have any money now, but we want it today, so we buy it by credit, with an annual interest rate of 15%, for a period of 6 years, which divides into a monthly payment of approximately $1,057.

                            From the example we learn that:
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            1.	At the end of the 72 months (6 years) the owner of the car would have paid $76, 122 <br>
                            2.	The extra payment is more than $26, 122 more than the cost of the car due to the interest. <br>
                            (The example does not include insurance and other costs that financial entities charge their customers with)
