    <h2>Rafa</h2>
    <p>Good day to all. My name is Rafael Majano; my friends call me Rafa. I am taking this 
        class as part of my bachelor's degree in Applied Technology. I am married to my lovely 
        wife Sandra and, as you can see in the picture, we have three wonderful children.</p>
    <p>We live in El Salvador, a small country down here in Central America. I love playing 
        basketball and watching sports and action movies. I have been working in IT for about 
        23 years now. I work for the IBM partner in Central America and the Caribbean.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church since I was born. My mother's family is among the 
        first members of the Church here in El Salvador. My wife served a full-time mission 
        in Honduras, and I served in Guatemala about the same time. Our son came back from his 
        mission in Mexico, and one of our daughters is getting ready for serving next year when 
        she turns 19th.</p>
    <p>I look forward to working with all of you this semester. I do not have any experience in 
        web development but, please, let me know if there is something I can help you with.</p>
